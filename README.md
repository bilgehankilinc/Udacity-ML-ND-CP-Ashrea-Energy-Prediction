Bilgehan Kilinc Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project

Ashrea Energy Prediction III Kaggle Competition

In this project folder there are 2 .ipynb notebooks and 4 .py scripts. 

This project requires latest anaconda navigator and an updated conda environment with python 3.7 or later.

First download this Repo into a folder.

Second please download data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data and put it into a folder named 'aep-data' in repo folder you downloaded at first step.

The reproducing process of codes in the report is:
    
    1. Start and Finish aep_eda_visualization.ipynb - This will create figurese used in 2.2. Exploratory Visualization Section
    2. Start and Finish aep_preprocessing.ipynb - This will create preprocessed DataFrame and saves it as a csv file for py. scripts.
    3. Start and Finish aep-feature_selection.py - This will output results mentioned at 3.2. Implementation/Feature Selection section.
    4. Start and Finish aep_model_selection.py - This will output results mentioned at 3.2. Implementation/Model Selection section.
    5. Start and Finish aep_lightgbm_model.py - This will output results mentioned at 3.3. Refinement section.
    6. Start and Finish aep_linearregression_model.py - This will output results mentioned at 4.2. Justification section.
